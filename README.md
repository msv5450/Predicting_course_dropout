# Predicting_course_dropout


This project was done using Python Data Science libraries
• The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using Pandas-Profiling which does the entire process automatically.
• I have included the complete EDA results in HTML format inside the EDA folder. You can open it
with any browser
• The Python codes are included so that you can execute them in Jupyter notebook
• To test your own set of Student IDs and verify my model, please read the instructions that I have
provided on the first page after the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) figures.
