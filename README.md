# Predicting_course_dropout


This code implements several different types of Machine Learning models, after cleaning the provided
data sets, to perform a binary classification. The outcome of the code is a model with a
reasonable accuracy that predicts whether a student will drop out or not given their student ID. Various types of categorical and continuous data in the context of Financial data, Student progress data and Student static data are provided to serve as the input parametrs based on which the prediction will be made. 

Run the "student_dropout_prediction" Python code.

• The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using Pandas-Profiling which does the entire process automatically.

• I have included the complete EDA results in HTML format inside the EDA folder. You can open it
with any browser

• The Python codes are included so that you can execute them in Jupyter notebook

• To test your own set of Student IDs and verify my model, please read the instructions that I have
provided on the first page after the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) figures.
